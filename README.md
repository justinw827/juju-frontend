### Description
Front end portion of app that runs with [juju-backend](https://github.com/justinw827/juju-backend). Made using React and Redux, along with Semantic UI React for styling.

Full application (front end & back end) allows you to log in with your Spotify account, linking your account with the app. Once logged in, you can create a party, which also creates a Spotify playlist in your account. Other people can join your party and add songs to your playlist, making the playlist a queue of songs. Songs are added to the queue (playlist) by searching for a song in the search bar, and clicking 'Add to Queue', adding the song to the active party's playlist.
